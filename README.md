- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Carnotfr, a hardworking and collaborative individual who thrives to gain skills at 
an early age in Computer Science, Finance, Python programming, Data Analysis, and he recently began 
focusing on looking for volatility dislocation in options and currency pairings, as well as large-cap 
equities. He intends to employ innovative statistical and high-end machine learning algorithms in solving 
finance-related problems. Moreover, his primary goal is to produce technologies that use systematized, organized 
thinking embodied in an algorithmic approach to trading.
